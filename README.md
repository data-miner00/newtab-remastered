# Newtab Remastered

A project that was heavilly inspired by Google Chrome's new tab page and intends to mitigate some of the shortcoming and add more functionalities that suits the most for my current workflow.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots for the application. The background picture is a bad choice as some of the words in white colour does not contrast well. Currently dark background is only supported.

### Main page
